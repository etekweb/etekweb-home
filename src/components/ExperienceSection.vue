      In this position, I worked closely with a variety of local businesses 
      to troubleshoot Windows computer system problems, 
      perform IT-related maintenance and setup tasks, 
      and train users on the use of new software and hardware.<br>
      This position also involved work with network systems, 
      including designing an office Ethernet network plan and 
      cable management in a large-office network rack.
