      <b>Theatre and Live Events</b><br>
      I enjoy working in live environments, with lots of action to handle.<br>
      This drew me into working in technical theatre, specifically live sound and lighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In middle and high school, I was an avid participant in handling the tech side of theatre:
      making sure mics were distributed, working, and sounding as good as possible within the constraints of our show’s budget.<br>
      I also participated in a touring theatre group my junior and senior year,
      requiring quick action and task delegation to continue high-quality performances with unknown venues and tight timetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      In college, I have continued working in live events and shows with the Sound and Lighting Services organization at Michigan Tech.

      <b>Athletics</b><br>
      Throughout high school, I was heavily involved in running, Nordic skiing, and track.
      While the sports were individual overall,
      their team-driven aspects were greatly motivating for me to keep going and make new bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In college, I have continued running to some degree. 
      However, I have found a renewed interest in cycling, including heading out to the trails for some mountain biking.<br>
      I’ve also started doing more Alpine skiing in the winter months.
      While I’d downhill skied with my family before,
      I’ve been learning how to safely tackle greater adventures than can be found at my home hill.
