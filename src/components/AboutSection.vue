    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Ethan Matzdorf. 
      I was born and raised in Cloquet, MN and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a young age, I have taken great interest in technology in various forms, exploring and learning about all of the many possibilities they contain.<br>
      I experimented with rudimentary web design starting at age seven, and in sixth grade began learning the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.<br>
      From there, I took initiative in developing web projects for my community that are in production use today: a registration utility for a middle school enrichment class program, and a trail map system at a local park.
    </p>
    <p>
      In college, I have been working for 24G, a digital experience agency, as a JavaScript developer.<br>
